## 1. About the Project
This project provides a [short explanation of purpose].  
Key features include:
- A scheduling/booking calendar.  
- User authentication and session handling.  
- Resource management (e.g., rooms, desks, equipment).  
- Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Fluent UI** for a modern UI.  

The repo is intended both as a working application and a **starting point** for similar projects.

## 2. Branching Strategy Decision
We use a simple and consistent branching strategy to keep the repository clean:  
- All work starts from the `main` branch.  
- Branch naming conventions:  
  - `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/login-form`)  
  - `bugfix/<short-description>` (e.g., `bugfix/calendar-bug`)  
  - `hotfix/<short-description>` (for urgent production fixes)  
- Pull Requests must be reviewed before merging.  

This strategy ensures clarity, easy tracking of work, and smooth collaboration.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```
### Install Dependencies

### Development Container (Optional)
- Open the repo in VS Code.
- With the Remote - Containers extension, select Reopen in Container.

## 4. Automation & Workflows
We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and collaboration discipline:
- Linting & Formatting: Code is checked on each pull request.
- Tests: Automated tests ensure stability.
- PR Reviews: Every PR must be reviewed before merging.
- Issue → Branch → PR → Review → Merge is the expected workflow.
These workflows reduce friction and help the team collaborate efficiently.

## 5. Metrics
To track collaboration and efficiency, we reflect on:
- Time from Issue creation → PR merge
- Number of PRs merged per week
These metrics are reviewed to improve teamwork, identify bottlenecks, and ensure steady progress.
