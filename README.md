# SS---Study-Point-Opgave-2

We use **GitHub Flow** as our branching strategy.

- Always branch off `main`.
- Use feature branches (`feature/xyz`) and bugfix branches (`bugfix/abc`).
- Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`.
- Require at least 1 approval before merging.

### Why GitHub Flow?
We chose GitHub Flow because:
- It is simple and lightweight, making it easy for the whole team to follow.
- It encourages small, frequent Pull Requests, which improves collaboration and code quality.
- It integrates well with GitHub Projects, Issues, and Actions (automation).
- It fits our project, where continuous integration and frequent deployments are more important than long-lived release branches.
